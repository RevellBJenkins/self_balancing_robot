# Self-Balancing Robot

## Purpose
This project exists to develop a clear understanding of sensor-driven balance and feedback control using a two-wheeled robot. The focus is on predicting behavior, not achieving balance by trial and error.

## System Overview
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller
- DC motors driven through an H-bridge
- IMU used for orientation sensing

## Current Status
- Hardware assembled
- Motor actuation verified
- No balance logic implemented
- IMU not yet characterized

## Next Milestone
Isolate and understand IMU behavior by reading raw accelerometer and gyroscope data and observing response to physical motion.
